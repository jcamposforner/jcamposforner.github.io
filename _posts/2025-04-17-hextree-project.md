## Project Summary

I built a fast and reliable spatial indexing library using hexagonal grids in Rust. This project tackles the challenge
of efficiently organizing and querying geographic data through a specialized tree structure.

## Key Technical Work

- Built a hexagonal grid system that organizes geographic data more naturally than traditional square grids
- Wrote the entire codebase in Rust to ensure performance
- Created algorithms that accurately detect which hexagons fall inside complex polygon shapes
- Developed a system that can handle different-sized hexagons in the same data structure
- Implemented practical geographic processing techniques that work well with real-world data
- Designed custom KD-tree implementation for efficient nearest-neighbor searches
- Optimized spatial queries using priority queues and min-heaps for distance-based sorting

## Core Functionality

- Quick lookup of neighboring hexagons
- Fast range queries to find all hexagons within specified boundaries
- Polygon containment detection to identify hexagons fully inside arbitrary shapes
- Partial coverage calculation to determine what percentage of a hexagon falls within a polygon
- Dynamic resolution adjustment to achieve 99.9% accuracy while maintaining performance
- Support for multi-resolution hexagons to balance precision and processing speed
- K-nearest neighbor searches using KD-tree spatial partitioning
- Priority-based processing using custom heap implementations
